# graphattan
slightly unreasonable by most people's standards

## Overview
This project models the progress of a pedestrian through a grid of city streets, inspired by a series of conversations
about walking commutes in Manhattan. A shared dislike of waiting at intersections and desire to optimize these trips encouraged the participants to consider the following questions:
- What distinct patterns emerged over many trips?
- What rules governed the decision made to turn one way or another at an intersection?
- By observing many successive trips, could those rules be modified to consistently result in more optimal commutes?

### CityGraph
- Basic CityGraph model is described [here](https://github.com/erchiggins/graphattan/wiki/CityGraph).
- Construction of a simple, programmatically generated grid based on Midtown Manhattan is described [here](https://github.com/erchiggins/graphattan/wiki/MidtownGraphBuilder).
