# manhattan-project
slightly unreasonable by most people's standards

## Overview
This project models the progress of a pedestrian through a grid of city streets, inspired by a series of conversations
about walking commutes in Manhattan. A shared dislike of waiting at intersections inspired the participants to consider
the following questions:
- What distinct patterns emerged over many trips?
- What rules governed the decision made to turn one way or another at an intersection?
- By observing many successive trips, could those rules be modified to consistently result in more optimal commutes?
